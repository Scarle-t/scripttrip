# Script Trip
This Final Year Project is called Script Trip, a travel companion app.

Bachelor of Computer Science, University of Wollongong

# Description
This project is accomplished with a team of 5, I was in charge of the UI and UX, back-end, API for iOS and native iOS front-end development. Whole project was delivered and presented in 2019 with completed iOS version, Android version was not ready at the time of completion.
We used IIS (Windows Server), MySQL and PHP with JSON as back-end and API solutions. For designing UI and UX, we have used Adobe XD to showcase and as a design guideline for both iOS and Android team.
For developing iOS app, I use Swift and XCode to build the app. This repo is all the source code for native iOS app.
